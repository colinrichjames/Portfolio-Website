# Colin James | Professional Portfolio

**Engineering Leader with a Business Core & MSCS in Human-Computer Interaction**

## 🎯 Executive Summary

I bridge the gap between complex engineering and strategic business impact. My work is defined by leading high-scale technical transformations at **AT&T** and conducting graduate-level research at **Georgia Tech** focused on how humans interact with AI and ubiquitous systems.

## 🛠️ The Technical Stack

* **Frontend & UX:** React, Next.js, Framer Motion (3D Interactions), Tailwind CSS.
* **Backend & AI:** Node.js, Python, OpenAI API, Azure Cloud, Java.
* **Engineering Systems:** Unity (C#), Arduino (IoT), ML (Random Forest Classifiers).
* **Methodologies:** SAFe Agile (Certified PO/PM), SDLC Automation, HCI Design Strategy.

## ✨ Portfolio Highlights & Architecture

### 1. Interactive "Proof" System (The Flip Cards)

To demonstrate my leadership philosophy, I engineered a **Progressive Disclosure** UI. This allows recruiters to see my core values (People, Process, Product) and "flip" to see hard-metric evidence:

* **People:** Mentored **80+ engineers** to achieve a **20% productivity boost**.
* **Process:** Architected a **Unified Front Door (UFD)** for **16,000+ users** to modernize enterprise intake.
* **Product:** Engineered a mobile self-install journey for **500,000+ customers**.

### 2. Graduate Research & Engineering (Georgia Tech MSCS)

My project portfolio showcases a deep dive into **HCI** and **AI Ethics**:

* **MKRHome:** A full-stack React/Node.js app utilizing **OpenAI** to assist adult learners in DIY projects.
* **Ramblin' City:** A Unity-based open-world simulation featuring complex AI steering behaviors (hostile swarms and pathfinding) and modular quest architecture.
* **IoT Smart Glove:** A wearable prototype using a **Random Forest classifier** for real-time gesture-based home automation.

## 📈 Professional Roadmap (AT&T)

* **Engineering Product Lead (Seattle):** Orchestrating the **UFD ecosystem**, bridging 6+ stakeholder groups with DevOps and Data Science teams to manage the full SDLC for 16k users.
* **Technology Development Program (Dallas):** Executed an **$18M Azure migration** and managed high-stakes rotations in Software Engineering and UX Design.

## 🎓 Education & Credentials

* **MSCS, Georgia Tech:** Specialization in Human-Computer Interaction (3.8 GPA).
* **B.A., UW Foster School of Business:** Management Information Systems (3.5 GPA).
* **Certifications:** SAFe Agilist, SAFe Product Owner/Product Manager, Udacity Nanodegrees (Programming & UX).
